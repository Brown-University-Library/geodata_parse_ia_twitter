These sample files illustrate what the data looks like, helpful if you wanted to modify the scripts. 
From the IA Twitter Stream from Nov 1st, 2022.

- 20221101_sample_records_all_types.json: Over 77k records, includes both geolocated and non-geolocated data tweets. Parsed from the JSONL files, output from twitter_parse_ia_files.py

- sample_tweets_all_types_20221101.csv: The same 77k records, output from twitter_json_to_csv.py, parsed to select specific elements and values

- examples_geo_tweets.txt: three geolocated records, pretty printed so the elements and values are readable (but not in true / strict JSON format)
